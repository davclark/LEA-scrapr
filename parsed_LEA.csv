CCSS is a great opportunity to get back to an educational program that focuses on the whole child. There is however great frustration with the rollout of both CCSS & SBAC. To think that 1,000+ LEAs in California are all doing the same thing, independently, with only modest resources to accomplish the awareness, transition and implementation of both CCSS and SBAC testing is mind boggling. As an individual District we have our plan and are doing quite well to transition and implement. I would encourage the CDE to support strategies for successful program implementation that include: the use of regional consortiums for productive collaboration (i.e., CORE); greater transparency of the real implementation timeline and expectation (years); and recognition and resource support, including improving communications for SBAC plans and implementation.CCSS is a great opportunity to get back to an educational program that focuses on the whole child.

CCSS is a great opportunity to get back to an educational program that focuses on the whole child. There is however great frustration with the rollout of both CCSS & SBAC. To think that 1,000+ LEAs in California are all doing the same thing, independently, with only modest resources to accomplish the awareness, transition and implementation of both CCSS and SBAC testing is mind boggling. As an individual District we have our plan and are doing quite well to transition and implement. I would encourage the CDE to support strategies for successful program implementation that include: the use of regional consortiums for productive collaboration (i.e., CORE); greater transparency of the real implementation timeline and expectation (years); and recognition and resource support, including improving communications for SBAC plans and implementation.CCSS is a great opportunity to get back to an educational program that focuses on the whole child.

It may have sounded like a good idea to people who don't have to implement it, but it is a burden on education, which is already strapped in many cases. In small districts like ours, we are doing well with the implementation, but it is causing an awful lot of stress.Please see previous comments.

Therefore, every classroom has some CCSS-aligned materials in ELA and Math that teachers are using.In addition to the materials is the need for understanding the CCSS and effective practices for teaching the rigorous standards. English learners, low socio-economic students, low achieving, and special education students need scaffolding in order to engage in the instruction. High-achieving and gifted students also need support to be able to extend and deepen their learning. There are questions about whether the new math programs that have been adopted by the SBE will provide the quality that is needed for students to acquire the mathematical understanding that is essential to the CCSS. One of our goals is effective instruction of the ELA and Math CCSS by knowledgeable and highly trained teachers who have high quality CCSS-aligned instructional materials.

CCSS is a great opportunity to get back to an educational program that focuses on the whole child. There is however great frustration with the rollout of both CCSS & SBAC. To think that 1,000+ LEAs in California are all doing the same thing, independently, with only modest resources to accomplish the awareness, transition and implementation of both CCSS and SBAC testing is mind boggling. As an individual District we have our plan and are doing quite well to transition and implement. I would encourage the CDE to support strategies for successful program implementation that include: the use of regional consortiums for productive collaboration (i.e., CORE); greater transparency of the real implementation timeline and expectation (years); and recognition and resource support, including improving communications for SBAC plans and implementation.CCSS is a great opportunity to get back to an educational program that focuses on the whole child.

Staff training has gone from the initial awareness phase to the transition/implementation phase.  Our original focus was on standards deconstruction and articulation.  Instructionally, we have used PLCs, staff meetings, student-free days and teacher release days to increase our capacity to deliver high impact instruction to every student.  Additionally, we have continued to implement our signature practices of: Reader's and Writer's Workshop, CGI, Guided Reading, Thinking Maps, Sandra Kaplan's Prompts of Depth and Complexity and The Gradual Release of Responsibility, all practices that are closely aligned with the instructional shifts of the Common Core. All teachers have taken the SBAC practice tests with their fellow colleagues, an effort that produced tremendous growth for our teachers and administrators. Lastly, we have created model units of study in grades 3-11 in math and ELA (at least one at each grade level 3-8 and two in grades 9-12) that we are using to learn more about how the Common Core looks and feels instructionally.Staff training has gone from the initial awareness phase to the transition/implementation phase.

We love the CCCS and are so happy to be doing this work for kids!  The challenging parts of implementation have been the lack of quality instructional resources, timeliness and lack  of communication, amount/number of changes that are connected with the Common Core (new math and ELA standards, LCFF, new ELD Standards, NGSS, LCAP, new assessment system, new assessments are technology based and the idea that there is time to work with local businesses and institutions of higher learning).

The implementation of CCSS is a daunting challenge but one with great importance.  We welcome the change and realize the long term impact on the education of our students is well worth the discomfort.  There are many challenges we are facing: learning new standards and realigning content, identifying appropriate resources, learning new pedagogy and learning how to integrate technology as a powerful tool for teaching and learning.  These are greater challenges than I have ever experienced in 30+ years of education.  Couple this with an entirely new model for funding and a new model for accountability and assessment and you are looking at systematic overload.  Please be mindful of not adding anything else to the mix.  We must be given the time to do this work thoughtfully and with quality.The implementation of CCSS is a daunting challenge but one with great importance.

As mentioned before, our biggest frustration is that the trainings offered are tailored for much larger schools. The assumption is that schools have departments within the curriculum and that there are several teachers teaching the same subject.  Collaborations within these trainings work under that assumption. Schools like ours that have teachers instructing in multiple grade levels with no co-workers sharing assignments do not benefit from training that takes this approach.

A success is that we are using PLCs as a an avenue for teacher PD, and it has been hugely successful.  A challenge is that this year there are so many new things LEAs are responsible for (SBAC, CCSS implementation, new math adoption committees, LCAP, Next Generation ELD Standards).  Each one on its own is an undertaking.

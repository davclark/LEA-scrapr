To think that 1,000+ LEAs in California are all doing the same thing, independently, with only modest resources to accomplish the awareness, transition and implementation of both CCSS and SBAC testing is mind boggling. As an individual District we have our plan and are doing quite well to transition and implement. I would encourage the CDE to support strategies for successful program implementation that include: the use of regional consortiums for productive collaboration (i.e., CORE); greater transparency of the real implementation timeline and expectation (years); and recognition and resource support, including improving communications for SBAC plans and implementation.CCSS is a great opportunity to get back to an educational program that focuses on the whole child.

We are concerned about the lack of  information regarding CCSS implementation and the home school environment.  I viewed the SBAC webinar regarding the upcoming test and a representative stated that they are still unsure how testing for non-public school will look.  We are a public school, however, we do have a home school component.  There are still a lot of unanswered questions regarding home school and testing.It would be great if the state had more guidelines and resources for home school and CCSS implementation.

CCSS is a great opportunity to get back to an educational program that focuses on the whole child. There is however great frustration with the rollout of both CCSS & SBAC. To think that 1,000+ LEAs in California are all doing the same thing, independently, with only modest resources to accomplish the awareness, transition and implementation of both CCSS and SBAC testing is mind boggling. As an individual District we have our plan and are doing quite well to transition and implement. I would encourage the CDE to support strategies for successful program implementation that include: the use of regional consortiums for productive collaboration (i.e., CORE); greater transparency of the real implementation timeline and expectation (years); and recognition and resource support, including improving communications for SBAC plans and implementation.CCSS is a great opportunity to get back to an educational program that focuses on the whole child.

Question 12: The district has not adopted new materials; however, CCSS-aligned materials are provided to all teachers in conjunction with each professional development session. Therefore, every classroom has some CCSS-aligned materials in ELA and Math that teachers are using.In addition to the materials is the need for understanding the CCSS and effective practices for teaching the rigorous standards. English learners, low socio-economic students, low achieving, and special education students need scaffolding in order to engage in the instruction. High-achieving and gifted students also need support to be able to extend and deepen their learning. There are questions about whether the new math programs that have been adopted by the SBE will provide the quality that is needed for students to acquire the mathematical understanding that is essential to the CCSS. One of our goals is effective instruction of the ELA and Math CCSS by knowledgeable and highly trained teachers who have high quality CCSS-aligned instructional materials. This will result in student learning as demonstrated on the SBAC formative and summative assessment measures.Question 12: The district has not adopted new materials; however, CCSS-aligned materials are provided to all teachers in conjunction with each professional development session.

CCSS is a great opportunity to get back to an educational program that focuses on the whole child. There is however great frustration with the rollout of both CCSS & SBAC. To think that 1,000+ LEAs in California are all doing the same thing, independently, with only modest resources to accomplish the awareness, transition and implementation of both CCSS and SBAC testing is mind boggling. As an individual District we have our plan and are doing quite well to transition and implement. I would encourage the CDE to support strategies for successful program implementation that include: the use of regional consortiums for productive collaboration (i.e., CORE); greater transparency of the real implementation timeline and expectation (years); and recognition and resource support, including improving communications for SBAC plans and implementation.CCSS is a great opportunity to get back to an educational program that focuses on the whole child.

Staff training has gone from the initial awareness phase to the transition/implementation phase.  Our original focus was on standards deconstruction and articulation.  Instructionally, we have used PLCs, staff meetings, student-free days and teacher release days to increase our capacity to deliver high impact instruction to every student.  Additionally, we have continued to implement our signature practices of: Reader's and Writer's Workshop, CGI, Guided Reading, Thinking Maps, Sandra Kaplan's Prompts of Depth and Complexity and The Gradual Release of Responsibility, all practices that are closely aligned with the instructional shifts of the Common Core. All teachers have taken the SBAC practice tests with their fellow colleagues, an effort that produced tremendous growth for our teachers and administrators. Lastly, we have created model units of study in grades 3-11 in math and ELA (at least one at each grade level 3-8 and two in grades 9-12) that we are using to learn more about how the Common Core looks and feels instructionally.Staff training has gone from the initial awareness phase to the transition/implementation phase.

The implementation of CCSS is a daunting challenge but one with great importance.  We welcome the change and realize the long term impact on the education of our students is well worth the discomfort.  There are many challenges we are facing: learning new standards and realigning content, identifying appropriate resources, learning new pedagogy and learning how to integrate technology as a powerful tool for teaching and learning.  These are greater challenges than I have ever experienced in 30+ years of education.  Couple this with an entirely new model for funding and a new model for accountability and assessment and you are looking at systematic overload.  Please be mindful of not adding anything else to the mix.  We must be given the time to do this work thoughtfully and with quality.The implementation of CCSS is a daunting challenge but one with great importance.

As mentioned before, our biggest frustration is that the trainings offered are tailored for much larger schools. The assumption is that schools have departments within the curriculum and that there are several teachers teaching the same subject.  Collaborations within these trainings work under that assumption. Schools like ours that have teachers instructing in multiple grade levels with no co-workers sharing assignments do not benefit from training that takes this approach.  What we need is someone to come to our school and give us instructional strategies that are both common to classrooms and yet unique to grade levels.We are using the resources and tools that are available on line and from the county office and developing a plan that works for our small school and our unique situation.As mentioned before, our biggest frustration is that the trainings offered are tailored for much larger schools.

Rescue Union is well on the way to full implementation of the CCSS.  Knowing this is not a state decision, we do feel like freezing schools in Program Improvement (even with API scores over the mid-800s) is really ludicrous federal policy.  We have appreciated the support of CDE in this process and thank the State for finally funding the implementation of the Common Core.  Funding technology continues to be a great challenge locally, we hope a bond for statewide technology is in the works.  We need it!

Calendars are far before a school year begins and this ""last minute"" expectation to conduct they types of ""field tests"" required with information not finalized until 2-3 weeks before the actual test is a burden on our school staff--administration and teachers to say nothing of the stress imposed on our students.As a high school district, we are lucky it is only 11th grade--but with the added testing for EAP our juniors may simply walk-out!Key challenge is trying to make sense of this within the disorganization and lack of clarity from the CDE.  100 plus powerpoints are not helpful--nor are the flashes and revised flashes being sent multiply times.

A success is that we are using PLCs as a an avenue for teacher PD, and it has been hugely successful.

Each one on its own is an undertaking.  Funding has not caught up enough that we have the personnel to do the work.A success is that we are using PLCs as a an avenue for teacher PD, and it has been hugely successful.
